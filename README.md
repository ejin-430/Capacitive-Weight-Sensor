# Capacitive-Weight-Sensor

A lightweight, STM32-based capacitive pressure sensing project that estimates weight by measuring changes in capacitance. This project uses a homemade capacitor (constructed from aluminum foil and a dielectric foam layer) to detect applied force or weight. The capacitor's value changes based on compression, which is read by an STM32 microcontroller. Data is transmitted over UART for real-time monitoring.
